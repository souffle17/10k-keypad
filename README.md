# 10k-keypad with variable input hall sensors

A 2x5 mechanical keypad PCB, with circuitry by me, based off of [my previous design](https://github.com/souffle17/6k-keypad). 

The second row supports hall-effect switches with variable input, similar to those on rapid trigger/wooting keyboards.

SW_MX_HS_CPG151101S11_1u_no_center_piece.kicad_mod is a modified version of the marbastlib-mx:SW_MX_HS_CPG151101S11_1u footprint from the marbastlib library.

(wip)
